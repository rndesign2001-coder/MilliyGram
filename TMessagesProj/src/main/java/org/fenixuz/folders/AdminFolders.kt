/**
 * Four folders that sort the user's groups and channels by the rights they hold in them:
 * groups they own, groups they administer, channels they own, channels they administer.
 *
 * Two things about this are worth stating plainly, because they shape every decision below.
 *
 * FIRST: Telegram folders live on the SERVER, not on this device. Creating them writes to the user's
 * account and the folders show up in official Telegram on their phone, desktop and web. That is why
 * nothing here happens without an explicit confirmation, and why turning the feature off offers to
 * remove exactly the four folders we made and nothing else.
 *
 * SECOND: Telegram has no "I am an admin here" filter flag — the auto-include flags are only
 * contacts / non-contacts / groups / broadcasts / bots. So membership has to be an explicit peer list,
 * which makes these folders a SNAPSHOT: a group the user is promoted in tomorrow will not appear on its
 * own, and one they are demoted from will linger. Hence [refresh], and hence the wording of string 397.

     * position, its id, its pinned dialogs and its exclusions, and the worst a broken chain can now do is
     * leave one folder un-updated.
