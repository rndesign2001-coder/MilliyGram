/**
 * Novagram "Protect from strangers" — one-on-one chats with people NOT in your contacts (not bots,
 * not yourself, not Telegram's own official/support accounts) are filed into a separate "Stranger
 * chats" inbox: hidden from the main list, silent (no notification), and excluded from the unread
 * badges.
 *
 * STICKY by design (user request 2026-06-13): a stranger that appears while the shield is ON is
 * CAPTURED into the inbox and STAYS there even after the shield is turned OFF — because it is still a
 * stranger. A NEW stranger that writes while the shield is OFF is NOT captured, so it shows up in the
 * main list normally (capturing only happens while protection is on). If a captured stranger later
 * becomes a contact, [isStranger] turns false and they leave the inbox / reappear in the main list.
 *
 * Because "off" is therefore NOT symmetric with "on", switching the shield OFF must ASK (user feedback
 * 2026-08-13: people turned it off, saw nothing come back and read it as a bug). The settings toggle
 * shows [countCaptured] and offers [releaseCaptured] — "return them to the main list" — or keeping the
 * inbox as it is. Silently emptying the inbox is wrong too: for many users the whole point is that a
 * stranger stays filed away.
 *
 * Switching it back ON asks NOTHING and is a clean re-arm: [clearAllowed] wipes the "Not a stranger"
 * whitelist so every current stranger is filed again, no exceptions. That is not drift — it only happens
 * when the user deliberately turns protection back on, which means "file all strangers" — and it doubles
 * as the undo for a mis-tapped [trust], which is why no re-hide prompt and no reverse menu item exist.
 * So: [trust] lasts until the next re-arm; one question total, on the OFF direction only.
 *
 * The single source of truth is [belongsInInbox] = "a stranger AND (shield on OR captured)". Every
 * surface uses it: the dialog list (hide / inbox), notifications, and both unread badges — so they
 * never disagree (no "badge counts a chat you can't see").
 *
 * EVERYTHING is PER-ACCOUNT — the switch as well as the sets (the sets since 2026-06-15, the switch
 * since 2026-08-13). Dialog ids are account-scoped, so the same id being a stranger in account A must
 * never hide it in account B; and the switch has to match, because a global switch sitting on top of
 * per-account sets is what made "turn it off" reachable for the current account only. It is also the
 * useful shape: strangers writing to a work account is the point, on a personal account it isn't. The
 * sets are self-pruned on every toggle — ids whose user became a contact or whose dialog was deleted
 * are dropped — so they can't grow forever.
 *
 * Clean, optimised rewrite of pro's `MyContact` (which mutated storage on the render hot path with
 * Gson + blocking commit(), filtered in two places with O(N·M) loops, faked a paid-message cost,
 * spammed per-stranger network mutes, and force-enabled unrelated features). Here: a lock-free flag +
 * per-account captured sets, O(1) hot-path reads, async writes, no network, device-only.
